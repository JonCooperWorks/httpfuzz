[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/joncooperworks/httpfuzz)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/joncooperworks/httpfuzz)

`httpfuzz` is a fast HTTP fuzzer written in [Go](https://golang.org) inspired by [Burp Intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder).
It takes a seed request and uses a wordlist to generate requests.
For a wordlist with `m` words and a seed request with `n` injection points, `httpfuzz` will generate `m * n` requests.
It can be used as a library, but is meant to be used with the included `httpfuzz` CLI.
It allows fuzzing of HTTP requests with text bodies and multipart file uploads.

### File Fuzzing
`httpfuzz` can generate files to help you quickly test a file upload endpoints for file header whitelisting using the `--automatic-file-payloads` flag.
It generates random bytes and puts a valid file headers on them before injecting them into the request body and sending them to the web service.
This lets you easily see if a dev team is only using filenames to validate image uploads ;).
You can see a list of the supported file types in [fileheaders.go](https://github.com/JonCooperWorks/httpfuzz/blob/master/fileheaders.go).
Feel free to add any file types you see missing.

If you want to use `httpfuzz` with existing payloads, simply place them in a directory and pass it to the `payload-dir` flag.

```

Seed requests are a text HTTP request.
You can tag injection points in request bodies by surrounding them with the delimiter character specified at program startup with the `--target-delimiter` flag.
By default, it's `` ` ``.
You can fuzz other parts of the request with CLI flags.

### Plugins
`httpfuzz` supports [Go plugins](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) so you can use the full power of Go to analyse requests and responses.
An `httpfuzz` plugin is a regular Go plugin with a function called `New` that implements `httpfuzz.InitializerFunc`.
You can use plugins to save request-response transactions to disk, log them to a database or perform multi-stage attacks.
If you need to configure your plugins, use environment variables prefixed with your plugin's name to minimizes collisions.

```
// InitializerFunc is a go function that should be exported by a function package.
// It should be named "New".
// Your InitializerFunc should return an instance of your Listener with a reference to httpfuzz's logger for consistent logging.
type InitializerFunc func(*log.Logger) (Listener, error)
```

The `httpfuzz.Listener` interface has oen method: `Listen`.

```
// Listener must be implemented by a plugin to users to hook the request - response transaction.
// The Listen method will be run in its own goroutine, so plugins cannot block the rest of the program, however panics can take down the entire process.
type Listener interface {
	Listen(results <-chan *Result)
}
```

`Listen` implementations will receive a stream of  `httpfuzz.Result`.
These contain the `httpfuzz.Request`, the payload and the `httpfuzz.Response`, along with some other metadata.

```
// Result is the request, response and associated metadata to be processed by plugins.
type Result struct {
	Request     *Request
	Response    *Response
	Payload     string
	Location    string
	FieldName   string
	TimeElapsed time.Duration
}
```

### Examples

#### Fuzzing POST requests

```
POST /api/devices HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.26.3
Accept: */*
Cache-Control: no-cache
Postman-Token: c5bcc2bc-90b4-4d06-b851-1cc670cd9afa
Host: localhost:8000
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Content-Length: 35

{
	"name": "`S9`",
	"os": "Android"
}
```

The backticks (`` ` ``) indicate a spot in the request body to inject payloads from the wordlist.

```
httpfuzz \
   --wordlist testdata/useragents.txt \
   --seed-request testdata/validPOST.request \
   --target-header User-Agent \
   --target-header Host \
   --delay-ms 50 \
   --target-header Pragma \
   --skip-cert-verify \
   --proxy-url http://localhost:8080 \
   --target-param fuzz \
   --dirbuster
```

In the above example, `httpfuzz` will insert values from the wordlist into the `name` field, the `Pragma`, `User-Agent` and `Host` headers, the end of the URL (like [dirbuster](https://tools.kali.org/web-applications/dirbuster#:~:text=DirBuster%20is%20a%20multi%20threaded,pages%20and%20applications%20hidden%20within.)) and the URL parameter `fuzz`.

#### Fuzzing multipart file uploads
`httpfuzz` can fuzz multipart files, both with automatically generated files and custom payloads supplied in a directory.
It can also fuzz filenames using the main wordlist to check for common file upload vulnerabilities like XSS and path injection.
```
POST /uploadFile HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:79.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/79.0
Content-Length: 1309
Accept: application/json
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: close
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------416891666813988703772682177556
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest

-----------------------------416891666813988703772682177556
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="image.png"
Content-Type: image/png

*image data here. real request is in validuploadPOST.request*
-----------------------------416891666813988703772682177556--

-----------------------------416891666813988703772682177556--
```

That request uploads a PNG file.
You can fuzz it with the following command:
```
httpfuzz \
 --wordlist testdata/useragents.txt \
 --seed-request testdata/validuploadPOST.request \
 --target-header User-Agent \
 --target-header Host \
 --delay-ms 50 \
 --target-header Pragma \
 --proxy-url http://localhost:8080 \
 --target-param fuzz \
 --dirbuster \
 --fuzz-file-size 4096 \
 --multipart-form-name field \
 --multipart-file-name file \
 --automatic-file-payloads \
 --target-filename file
 --payload-dir ./testpayloads
```

This command will fuzz a multipart form field called `field` and the file field `file` with randomly generated 4KB (4096 bytes) files and any payloads in the `./testpayloads` directory and filenames from the wordlist `testdata/useragents.txt`.
You can still fuzz the other injection points, but delimiter injection will not work, since binary files can contain any character they want.

### Building httpfuzz
To build `httpfuzz`, simply run `go build -o httpfuzz cmd/httpfuzz.go`.
You can run the tests with `go test -v`.
